\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------
\break

\question{How do I download/upload files within the cslab Linux environment? }\label{file_copying}

\subsection*{Using guacctl/guacget to download a file:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Within the SSH terminal session, you can use the \textit{Guacamole terminal session control utility (guacctl)} for downloading files. To download a file from the SSH terminal session to your local computer via the web-browser type:
\begin{verbatim}
guacget file_to_be_downloaded
\end{verbatim}
\item \texttt{guacget} is an alias for the command \texttt{guacctl --download}. To see all the option flags available for this command type \texttt{guacctl}.
\item \textbf{NOTE: \texttt{guacget} only works in SSH terminal sessions. \texttt{guacget} does not work in RDP desktop sessions.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Drag-and-drop to upload a file:}
\begin{itemize}
\item You can drag-and-drop a file from your local computer onto the cslab web-browser window. This can be used in both RDP desktop and SSH terminal sessions.
\item By default the file is uploaded into your user home directory on the remote cslab-node.
\item You can set a custom destination directory for future uploaded files when using drag-and-drop by typing:
\begin{verbatim}
guacctl -s custom_upload_directory
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\textit{Guacamole} file browser to upload or download a file:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the \textit{Guacamole} menu sidebar by pressing the key combination \textbf{Ctrl+Alt+Shift}.
\item Click on the disk drive icon under [Devices] to open a file browser of the remote cslab-node.
\item Browse to your user home directory on the remote server. You can then browse to subdirectories within your user home. Your home directory full path on the remote cslab-node will look like the following:
\begin{verbatim}
/opt/homes/stu##/your_myWSU_id/
\end{verbatim}
\item If you are unsure where your home directory is located on the remote cslab-node, in a terminal or in the SSH terminal session type \texttt{pwd} to show you the full path of your present working directory.
\item Downloads are initiated by double-clicking on any file shown, while uploads are initiated by clicking the [Upload Files] button. Clicking [Upload Files] will open a file browsing dialog where you can choose one or more files from your local computer, ultimately uploading the selected files to the directory currently displayed within the remote cslab-node file browser.
\item Close the \textit{Guacamole} menu sidebar by pressing the key combination \textbf{Ctrl+Alt+Shift}.
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------

\question{Can I open multiple browser tabs/windows into the cslab Linux environment? }\label{multiple_tabs}

\begin{itemize}
\item cslab restricts RDP desktop sessions to a single connection per user. You can view the remote RDP desktop session from only one web-browser tab/window at a time. If you attempt to open more than one web-browser tab/window and connect to a second RDP desktop session, then the gateway will present an error message in the second tab.
\item cslab restricts SSH terminal sessions to a maximum of four concurrent connections per user. You can open up to four web-browser tabs/windows and connect into remote SSH terminal sessions at the same time. Each open SSH terminal session tab/window will run a separate command-line shell instance on the same remote cslab-node.
\item You can use the \texttt{tmux} or \texttt{screen} terminal multiplexer commands to run multiple command-line shells concurrently in the same SSH session tab/window.
\item You can open one web-browser tab/window to connect to a graphical RDP desktop session and open additional tabs/windows to connect to SSH terminal sessions concurrently. However, the \textit{Apache Guacamole} system cannot guarantee that your RDP desktop session and your SSH terminal session(s) will connect to the same remote cslab-node.
\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------

\question{How do I access the cslab Linux environment on port 22 via an SSH client?}\label{ssh_client}

\begin{itemize}
\item The cslab-nodes are located inside a virtual private network. These internal nodes are only SSH accessible via the cslab-bastion.cs.wichita.edu jumphost. Any external connection into the cslab environment must proxy connect through the cslab-bastion and the bastion should be used only as an SSH jumphost/proxy.

\item If you are accessing cslab via SSH on WSU campus, ensure you are connected wirelessly to ``WSU Secure'' or using an Ethernet connected computer. ``WSU Guest'' wireless prohibits port 22 connections and your SSH session will fail to connect.

\item \textbf{Please only connect into the cslab environment with an SSH client if you have previous experience in using SSH and the Linux command-line. If you are new to Linux, please use the \hyperref[guac_login]{\textit{Guacamole} web-browser interface}.}
\end{itemize}
  
\subsection*{Using \textit{PuTTY} SSH client on Microsoft Windows:}
\begin{enumerate}
%% \item You can download pre-configured \textit{PuTTY} session and host key configurations for importing into your Windows registry from this link.

\item Download \textit{PuTTY} from \href{https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html}{Simon Tatham's official download webpage} and install.
\item Open \textit{PuTTY} and in [Session] category add a new SSH connection with \break [Host Name] as \texttt{cslab-bastion.cs.wichita.edu} and [Port] as \texttt{22}.

\item In [Connection--Data] category add your myWSU\_ID into [Auto-login username].
\item In [Connection--SSH] category add the text \texttt{ssh cslab} into [Remote command].
\item In [Session] category add a name for the configuration, such as ``cslab environment'' and click \textit{Save}. Saving as ``Default Settings'' will always open with this configuration.

\question{How do I use graphical (GUI) applications in cslab via an SSH client?}\label{x11_forwarding}

\textbf{Graphical applications cannot currently be accessed in Microsoft Windows using the \textit{PuTTY} SSH client. Please use the \hyperref[guac_login]{\textit{Guacamole} web-browser interface} instead. }

\subsection*{Using \textit{OpenSSH} client with X11 forwarding on Linux or Mac OSX:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure you have followed the directions in \hyperref[ssh_client]{using \textit{OpenSSH} client} first.
\item SSH allows for graphical applications to run on a local computer from the remote cslab Linux environment using X11 forwarding.
\item To use X11 forwarding on a per session basis append the \texttt{-X} option flag to your SSH command, i.e.
\begin{verbatim}
ssh -X cslab
\end{verbatim}
\item To always use X11 forwarding for connections to cslab, instead of using the \texttt{-X} option flag, add the following line to the \texttt{Host cslab cslab-last....} entry in your \texttt{ $\sim$/.ssh/config} file:
\begin{verbatim}
  ForwardX11 yes
\end{verbatim}
\item If you are using Mac OSX, then you may need to install XQuartz before using X11 forwarding. Download \href{https://www.xquartz.org}{XQuartz for Mac} and install the software package.
\end{itemize} 

%------------------------------------------------

\question{How do I copy files from/to the cslab Linux environment via an SSH client?}\label{scp_copying}

\subsection*{Using \textit{OpenSSH} client on Linux or Mac OSX:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure you have followed the directions in \hyperref[ssh_client]{using \textit{OpenSSH} client} first.
\item To copy a file from your local computer to your user home directory on cslab using Secure Copy (SCP), type

\texttt{scp local\_filename\_or\_path cslab:$\sim$}

\item To copy a file from your user home directory on cslab to a local directory on your local computer, type

\texttt{scp cslab:$\sim$/remote\_filename\_or\_path local\_directory}
\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------

\question{How do I access the last accessed cslab-node via an SSH client?}\label{ssh -last}

\begin{itemize}
\item When connecting to the cslab Linux environment using an SSH client, the ballast load-balancer on cslab-bastion will redirect you to one of the available and least used cslab-nodes at time of connection. Since load-balancing is calculated by ballast on a one minute cycle, you may not be redirected to the same cslab-node the next time you connect into cslab using SSH.

\item \textbf{Use the following instructions to connect to the last used cslab-node only if/when you need access into a previously running SSH connection. For normal use, your best option is always to connect via \texttt{ssh cslab} and let the ballast load-balancer automatically connect to an available node.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Using \textit{OpenSSH} client on Linux or Mac OSX:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If you need to connect to the last cslab-node you previously accessed using SSH, just append \texttt{-last} to the SSH command, i.e.
\begin{verbatim}
ssh cslab-last
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Using \textit{PuTTY} SSH client on Microsoft Windows:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open \textit{PuTTY} and load the previously created ``cslab environment'' session.
\item Change [Connections--Data] configuration category [Remote command] entry to \texttt{ssh cslab-last}.
\item \textit{Save} changed configuration as a new [Session] with a different name, such as ``cslab environment last used node''.
\item If you need to connect to the last cslab-node you previously accessed using SSH, connect using this newly created \textit{PuTTY} session.
\end{enumerate}

\question{What are the currently known bugs/glitches within the cslab Linux environment?}\label{known_bugs}

Due to the cslab environment being so new, there are a few software bugs and glitches which you may see at times. Most of these bugs occur during operations that involve the new cslab environment interacting with the older CS servers and functions and are not critical issues.

Known bugs include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A policykit error message pops up when user first logs into a \textit{Guacamole} RDP desktop session if other users are also logged in. This is a minor bug within policykit and can be easily mitigated by clicking \textit{Okay} in the pop-up window.
  \item When the \textit{handin} command is used in the cslab environment for programming assignment submission it may produce a \texttt{segmentation fault} error. This is caused by the older 32-bit \textit{handin} program running on the cslab 64-bit processor architecture. The error is minor and does not affect submission of student assignments for grading.
  \item When accessing cslab via an SSH client through the cslab-bastion, a \texttt{Could not chdir to home directory....} warning may be displayed. This is caused by cslab-bastion not having access to user home directories as an SSH connection is established. cslab-bastion is only used as an SSH jumphost to allow for external access into the cslab-nodes, and does not require access to user home directories for this function. The warning can be disregarded.
  \item Graphical (GUI) applications cannot currently be accessed in Microsoft Windows using the \textit{PuTTY} SSH client. This is due to a limitation with the \textit{PuTTY} client which requires SSH public key authentication for using the cslab-bastion as a secure SSH proxy. Adding public key authentication for SSH access into cslab is planned as a future option. For now, please use the \hyperref[guac_login]{\textit{Guacamole} web-browser interface} when graphical applications are required from a Microsoft Windows computer.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{If you experience a bug or error when using the cslab Linux environment which stops you from completing your programming assignments, please inform your instructor at your earliest convenience.}
